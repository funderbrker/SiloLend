[[{"l":"SiLend"},{"l":"What it is","p":["SiLend is a lending system for Beanstalk Silo deposits. It enables users to use their Bean Deposits as collateral to borrow liquid Bean."]},{"l":"Approach","p":["The protocol is intentionally designed to be as simple as possible. This enables quick and secure shipping of a tool with immediate value."]},{"l":"How does it is work","p":["SiLend offers a single pool. That pool pairs one supply token to one collateral token. The supply is Beans (ERC20) and the collateral is Bean Deposits (ERC1155). A user can take an undercollateralized Bean loan against their Bean deposit. They will owe interest on their loan, but their deposit will continue to accrue Stalk (i.e. ownership in Beanstalk). The supplier will earn immediate interest, regardless of the performance of the Silo.","A bean deposit can always be converted into a known number of Beans. This means that there is no need to use oracles or external liquidation mechanisms, significantly reducing complexity and smart contract risk. It also allows the pool to offer loans with very high utilization rates (90%)."]},{"i":"who-will-use-it","l":"Who will use it?","p":["Lenders- Users who are comfortable with exposure to Bean risk but want to see immediate yield on their capital.","Borrowers- Users who are long term bullish on Beanstalk but want to unlock their capital investment in the short term."]},{"l":"How to use","p":["Install forge, https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-install","To compile, run forge compile","To run all tests, run forge test"]}],[{"l":"Src"},{"l":"Notes","p":["Unused supply should be held in deposits","Withdraws are in Beans, not deposits. This removes ability/incentive to harvest high stalk deposits","Not an optimized Silo position. Enough to match a new Deposit.","Suppliers can receive an ERC20 representing their position","Should interest be higher or lower than fresh Silo Deposit?","If yes, short term supplying to BeanShare is always more profitable than Depositing.","If no, borrowers can leverage silo via looping.","If sometimes yes, sometimes no...?"]},{"l":"Feature Requests","p":["In the spirit of shipping value quickly, not every feature and capital optiization will be in v1.
